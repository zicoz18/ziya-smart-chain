# Ziya Smart Chain
This project could be seen as a simplified version of Ethereum blockchain
## Project's goal
- Create a PoW based, Ethereum like blockchain from scratch to deeply understand how they work

## Features

  - Interpreter for OpCodes
  - Creating Blocks and Blockchain
  - Proof of Work 
  - Mining and validating a Block
  - Networking, allow peers to interact. Send new blocks, transactions...
  - API to interact with the node via http calls
  - Creating Accounts and Smart Contract accounts
  - Creating and Validating Transactions
  - Global State to store both Smart Contracts' and accounts' state
  - Running code through making a transaction to a smart contract account
  - Storing and getting data from a smart contract's storage
  - Usage of gas and gasLimits

  
  
## Used technologies
  * Typescript is used for developing both the blockchain
  * Node is used as runtime environment for typescript
  * Express is used to create an API to interact with the blockchain
  * PubNub is used to establish the network between different nodes
